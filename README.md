# plc-workflows-mpc

A **Forge spoke module** for OT-side **advanced process control**, **PLC software-development lifecycle (SDLC)**, and **plant-wide optimization**.

> Status: **Phase 0 — scaffold.** The forge adapter contract is implemented (inject-only); the control, optimization, and SDLC pillars are defined as interfaces and built out in later phases. See [Roadmap](#roadmap).

---

## Why this repo exists

This module is the generalized, customer-customizable successor to **[plc-gbt](https://github.com/reh3376/plc-gbt)**.

plc-gbt grew into a single large application that bundled an IDE, an AI/RAG assistant, observability, control-loop analysis, and PLC format conversion. That made it hard to reuse across customers and blurred the boundaries between concerns. The [Forge framework](https://github.com/reh3376/forge) takes the opposite approach: a central **hub** with many small, single-responsibility **spoke modules** that each do one thing well and exchange data through a common contract (the `ContextualRecord`).

`plc-workflows-mpc` is the spoke that owns **OT process control and PLC engineering workflows**. It is built to be a **general framework that is customized per customer with minor changes** rather than a bespoke one-off — the value a systems integrator can offer as a drop-in Forge module.

Concerns that plc-gbt also handled — **observability and AI/ML analysis** — are deliberately **out of scope** here; those belong to their own dedicated Forge spokes.

## Purpose

Bring industrial process control and PLC development up to modern software standards, and connect them to the Forge platform so that every control decision is governed, contextual, and auditable.

## Goals (the four pillars)

1. **Forge core integration** — implement the Forge adapter contract so the module registers with and exchanges data through the hub.
2. **PLC SDLC** — git workflows and CI/CD pipelines (plus L5X/ACD ↔ text conversion) that bring PLC development in line with standard software development.
3. **Advanced Process Control** — instantiate **MPC/APC** controllers, and analyze processes to **select the correct control algorithm** (PID / APC / MPC) for each loop.
4. **Plant-wide optimization** — a real-time optimization layer that coordinates all controllers toward a **user-defined objective** (e.g. *"maximize proof gallons produced"*) subject to process and business constraints.

## How it fits into Forge

This spoke is an **APC controller** on the hub-and-spoke platform:

```
  hub ──subscribe──▶  PV / CV / SP  ─┐
                                      ├─▶  APC / MPC + optimization  ──▶  control moves
  hub ◀──write──────  setpoints / MV ─┘                                   │
  hub ◀──collect────  governed ContextualRecords of every decision  ◀─────┘
  hub ◀──discover───  managed control loops / controllers
```

- **subscribe** — receive process variables from the hub (fed by the OT/historian spokes).
- **compute** — the `apc` and `optimization` packages decide the moves.
- **write** — push setpoints/MV moves back to the PLC layer.
- **collect** — emit every controller decision and optimization result as a `ContextualRecord` (an auditable OT control trail).
- **discover** — enumerate the control loops/controllers this spoke manages.

## Linking MPC to the PLC (supervisory / advisory)

For **Rockwell Logix** PLCs the control link follows a proven supervisory pattern (the PLC keeps full authority; this service is advisory):

- **Transport:** EtherNet/IP via [`pycomm3`](https://docs.pycomm3.dev/) — plain Logix tags, TCP 44818, explicit messaging. No RSLinx or Studio 5000 SDK at runtime.
- **Division of responsibility:** the **PLC** owns everything safety- and timing-critical (regulatory PID, actuator, permissive, watchdog, and **hard setpoint clamps**). The **service** only computes *which value lands in the PID setpoint*, and only while permitted.
- **Control runtime:** an `IDLE → ARMING → RUNNING` state machine (`supervisor/`) with a re-arm hold-off and **bumpless transfer** on takeover. The service pulses a heartbeat the PLC watchdogs; if the service dies, hangs, or loses the network, the PLC reverts to local PID within ~2 s — no cooperation required.
- **The MPC core** (`apc/mpc/`): a constrained linear QP (OSQP) over a discrete state-space model, with **measured-disturbance feedforward** (act before the CV deviates) and an **offset-free Kalman observer** (zero steady-state error under unmeasured load).
- **Commissioning:** `dry_run` is on by default — the service reads and solves but never writes until you explicitly enable it.

This structure is adapted from the reference at `~/Documents/dailylog/plc-mpc/mpc-supervisor`; see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the PLC-side tag contract.

## Development

Requires **Python 3.12+** and [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Forge is private and not on PyPI, so install it editable from a local checkout.

```bash
uv venv

# Install the forge platform (provides `forge-platform`):
uv pip install -e /path/to/forge          # local checkout (recommended for dev)
# …or, with repo access:
# uv pip install "forge-platform @ git+https://github.com/reh3376/forge.git"

# Install this package + dev tooling:
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Quality gates:
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run mypy src
uv run pytest -v
```

The runtime control stack — the Rockwell EtherNet/IP link (`pycomm3`) and the QP solver (`osqp`) — lives in the optional `apc` extra and is needed once Pillar 3 implementation lands (Phase 2): `uv pip install -e ".[apc]"`.

## Roadmap

|-------|--------|-------|
| **0** *(done)* | Forge core | Adapter contract, manifest, FACTS spec, tests, CI — inject-only skeleton. |
| **1** *(done)* | APC | FOPDT/SOPDT identification (NLS, BIC selection), step detection, PID/APC/MPC strategy recommendation. |
| **2** | APC | MPC/APC controller instantiation on OSQP; supervisory state machine + live EtherNet/IP (pycomm3) and hub I/O. |
| **3** | SDLC | Git-native L5X/ACD↔text workflows + CI/CD pipeline templates for PLC code. |
| **4** | Optimization | Plant-wide RTO with user-defined objective functions coordinating controllers. |
